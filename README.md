# ARA
ARA, a fork from Arlin Keo and Thomas Abeel's MACAW2/ARA tool.
This fork contains an additional tool, unique-markers, which allows a user to identify unique markers for a set of genes.

### Building

Like with most scala projects, this tool is shipped with a build.xml file.
Use apache's ant utility to compile this.

The build produces a zip file ara-development.zip, that contains all the necessary jar files.
### Usage

The tool can be run with

java -jar ara.jar <tool> <tool options>
